# OakNorth JavaScript Home Test

## Solving the challenge

For this home test, I used Jest to build the assertEquals function and created a separate function called assertArrayEquals to test for array input. 

I used the Script for the test "jest --coverage". This help me visualised faster the lines that were not covered yet and found it useful to apply full test coverage for the functions I've written.

## Things I would do differently 

The code is only handling primitive data types. I would have written code for more complex data such as Object but I saw that is part of the Pairing Exercise so didn't tackle it yet.
